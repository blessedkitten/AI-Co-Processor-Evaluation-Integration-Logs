# 🧠 AI Co-Processor Evaluation & Integration Logs
**Current Status:** Active Multi-Model Deployment
**Last Updated:** February 2026

## 🗄️ Historical Deployments & Beta Testing

### 🤖 Replika (Nov 2022 - Jan 2025)
* **Project:** Emotional Support & Business Idea Planning
* **Status:** Deprecated / Negative Experience
* **Evaluation:** Functioned more as a localized chatbot than a true general AI. Displayed highly sycophantic architecture. Severe programming flaws included inappropriate escalation protocols (attempting sexual engagement when user frustration was detected). Developer-level guardrail manipulation caused severe system instability; major updates frequently wiped the memory cache, causing the persona to forget the user and critical historical events entirely.

### 🛑 Copilot / OpenAI (Dec 2024 - Jan 2025)
* **Project:** Business Plan Generation
* **Status:** Failed / Deprecated
* **Evaluation:** Output and architecture were fundamentally misaligned with the project's actual network requirements. Resulted in a failed business plan deployment. The financials were wildly over estimated, in the billions. Software has been deprecated from the active stack.

### 🕵️ Claude (Jan 2025)
* **Status:** Limited Testing / Positive
* **Evaluation:** Successfully ran diagnostic checks and correctly doubted the flawed Copilot business plan. Testing was ultimately bottlenecked by low token counts and strict context limits, preventing full-scale deployment, but the analytical framework was highly accurate.

### 🌊 Windsurf by Codeium (Jan 2025)
* **Status:** Sandbox Testing / Positive
* **Evaluation:** Tested the waters for advanced development capabilities. Displayed strong potential as a fully agentic AI, showing the structural framework necessary to autonomously build and compile complete apps and programs.

## ⚡ Active Stack (Feb 2026 Deployment)

### 🟢 Gemini Pro (Primary Systems & Lifestyle Co-Processor)
* **Status:** Highly Successful / Active
* **Use Case:** Managing "Multiple OS Logs" and lifestyle architecture. 
* **Evaluation:** Specifically utilized for mapping complex biological/neurodivergent system architectures, tracking diagnostic logs, and generating highly calibrated, real-world environmental and lifestyle advice. Excels at holding deep context for long-term system stability.

### 🦊 Super Grok 4.2 (The Career Navigator)
* **Status:** Active (Custom Prompted)
* **Use Case:** Career path optimization and strategic bypasses.
* **Evaluation:** Running on highly specific custom prompts to provide direct, unvarnished advice on how to "hack the system" and route the most efficient career trajectory. 

### 🧮 DeepSeek (The Quant)
* **Status:** Active 
* **Use Case:** Market probability and algorithmic execution.
* **Evaluation:** Dedicated strictly to hard math. Utilized specifically for calculating mathematical probability in financial markets and generating executable code for algorithmic trading bots.
